## Meet the team

### Noah Layton

Hey I'm Noah, I am excited to work on this project as I like the idea of making different effects. 
My idea for this is a campfire that is shooting smoke into the sky and (if possible) the fire would eventually 
go out. I have used Github for projects for a couple of years due to CART and last semester. 

### Justus Pettit

Hihi I'm Justus, I think we can make some cool stuff! My idea is essentially a ball pit, each of the balls are attracted to each other and whenever they collide they'll create little sparks and launch each other. I'm in the same boat as Noah, I used GitHub for several projects over the last 3 years for school, robotics, and various personal projects.

### Ella Siadto

Hello, I’m Ella and I’m excited to work on this project and get to know everyone in the group. My initial thought process when this project was introduced was BOOM big explosion and Mario’s fire flower powers, thus I really wanted to work on something pyro-related. I’m new to Github but I’ll definitely get a hang of it and I hope to be helpful to all of you. 

## What the file do

idk maybe once each file is done put a little descriptor here.
